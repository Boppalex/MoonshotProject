## 2. Project Overview ‚Äì Explained

The **Inventory Web App** is designed as a lightweight, free-to-use solution to promote **sustainable food consumption**. It allows users to track what they have at home, discover recipes using those ingredients, and reduce waste ‚Äî all while supporting offline access.

The following explains **what the app does**, **why each feature exists**, and **how it is implemented**.

---

### ‚ú® Objectives (What, Why, How)

* **What:** Enable users to manage kitchen inventory seamlessly.

  * **Why:** Manual tracking leads to forgotten or wasted items. A digital system improves awareness and organization.
  * **How:** Users can add, edit, or delete items in a simple UI backed by Firestore or local storage.

* **What:** Dynamically suggest recipes based on available ingredients.

  * **Why:** Encourages users to cook with what they already have, reducing unnecessary purchases.
  * **How:** A chatbot interface uses the Spoonacular API to generate recipe suggestions based on pantry contents.

* **What:** Provide a responsive, mobile-first UI.

  * **Why:** The primary user device is likely a smartphone in the kitchen. UX must be optimized for small screens.
  * **How:** The app uses Tailwind CSS and React for fast, responsive layouts.

* **What:** Support full offline functionality.

  * **Why:** Users may not always have stable internet access (e.g., while shopping or cooking).
  * **How:** Uses `IndexedDB` to cache data locally, syncing to Firestore when online.

---

### üîë Core Features ‚Äì With Purpose

#### 1. Inventory Management

* Core to the app‚Äôs mission ‚Äî tracks what users own.
* Users perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on their items, stored either in Firestore (if authenticated) or IndexedDB (if offline or in guest mode).
* **Extra:** Expiration tracking helps users prioritize usage before spoilage.

#### 2. Recipe Generation via Chatbot

* Solves the classic ‚ÄúWhat can I cook tonight?‚Äù problem using existing pantry items.
* Integrates with the Spoonacular API. Users input ingredients or meal types into a chatbot interface to receive recipe suggestions.
* **Extra:** The assistant provides links and images, improving engagement.

#### 3. Digital Cookbook

* Helps users follow instructions without switching platforms.
* Displays recipe cards with ingredient lists and step-by-step guides fetched via API.
* **Optional Feature:** After cooking, prompt to auto-remove used ingredients from inventory.

#### 4. User Authentication (Optional)

* Allows data sync across devices and stores user preferences.
* Firebase Authentication supports login with email/password or anonymous sign-in. Guest users rely on local caching (IndexedDB).
* **Security:** All Firestore records are tied to a UID to isolate data.

#### 5. Offline Capability

* Essential for usability in real-world kitchen or grocery scenarios.
* IndexedDB handles all CRUD operations offline. When the network returns, changes are synced to Firestore using a background service.

---

## 5. System Architecture

---

### 5.1 Technology Stack

| **Layer**            | **Tool/Technology**        | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**         | React + Vite                | UI rendering and app logic. Vite ensures fast build and hot reload in dev. |
| **Styling**          | Tailwind CSS                | Rapid UI development with mobile-first, utility-based design system.       |
| **Authentication**   | Firebase Auth               | Email/password-based user login; session persists across app reloads.      |
| **Database**         | Firebase Firestore          | Real-time NoSQL DB for storing user-specific inventory and recipes.        |
| **Local Caching**    | IndexedDB + localStorage    | Caches data offline; enables guest usage or fallback when offline.         |
| **Hosting** *(opt.)* | Firebase Hosting            | Lightweight static site hosting with HTTPS and global CDN (free tier).     |

> üîê **Only auth and inventory data are synced to Firebase.** Everything else (chat context, UI state, recipe browsing history) is handled locally for privacy, performance, and offline access.

---

### 5.2 Firebase Firestore Structure

We follow a **user-isolated data structure**. Each user has a personal `items` subcollection, which ensures data privacy and clean querying.

```plaintext
users/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {uid}/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ items/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {itemId} : {
             name: string,         // Item name, e.g. "Tomatoes"
             quantity: number,     // Integer or float depending on unit
             createdAt: timestamp, // Firestore auto timestamp
             status: string,       // e.g., "fresh", "expired", "used"
             tags?: string[]       // Optional: e.g. ["vegetable", "organic"]
        }
```

- Document path: `users/{uid}/items/{itemId}`
- All Firestore calls use the authenticated UID from Firebase Auth
- Firebase SDK automatically supports offline reads + queued writes

Best practices:
- Use `createdAt` for sorting/expiration features
- Filter and categorize via `tags`
- Store units or measurement type via additional fields if needed later

---

### 5.3 Flow Diagrams

#### Auth Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[App Load] --> B{Is user authenticated?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Fetch user data from Firestore]
    B -- No --> D[Redirect to Login page]
    D --> E[User signs in or registers]
    E --> C
```

- `onAuthStateChanged` checks Firebase Auth session on load
- If authenticated, fetch inventory from Firestore
- If not, redirect user to login or load guest mode with local data

**Pseudocode:**
```js
onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    // Authenticated session
    fetchUserInventory(user.uid); // Load inventory from Firestore
  } else {
    // Unauthenticated session
    navigateTo('/login'); // Or allow guest mode with local storage
  }
});
```

---

#### Inventory Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[App Start] --> B{Online or Offline?}
  B -- Online --> C{Is user authenticated?}
  C -- Yes --> D[Sync IndexedDB to Firestore]
  C -- No --> E[Use IndexedDB only]
  B -- Offline --> F[Load Inventory from IndexedDB]
```

- Ensures full CRUD even in guest or offline state
- Changes queued and synced to Firestore when reconnected
- IndexedDB stores the exact same structure for compatibility

**Pseudocode:**
```js
  if (navigator.onLine) {
    if (userIsAuthenticated()) {
      const localData = readFromIndexedDB();
      syncToFirestore(localData); // Push changes online
    } else {
      const guestData = readFromIndexedDB();
      useLocalState(guestData); // Guest mode, no sync
    }
  } else {
    const offlineData = readFromIndexedDB();
    useLocalState(offlineData); // Fully offline fallback
  }
```


---

#### Recipe Chatbot Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Inventory Page] --> B[User clicks on Suggest Recipe]
    B --> C[Collect available ingredients]
    C --> D[Send ingredients to Spoonacular API]
    D --> E[Receive recipe suggestions]
    E --> F[Display cards with Cook Now]
    F --> G[Show interactive, step-by-step instructions]
```

- Local pantry is the source of truth
- API queries only include ingredients the user has
- Assistant uses formatted prompt logic (non-AI) to query Spoonacular

**Pseudocode:**
```js
  function handleSuggestRecipe() {
    const ingredients = getAvailableIngredients(); // From inventory state

    fetch(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/findByIngredients?ingredients=${ingredients.join(',')}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(recipes => {
        displayRecipeCards(recipes); // Show as clickable cards
      });
  }

  function handleCookNow(recipeId) {
    fetch(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/${recipeId}/analyzedInstructions`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(steps => {
        showStepByStepInstructions(steps); // One step at a time
      });
  }
```

---

### 5.4 Data Persistence

**Authentication Persistence**

- Firebase Auth stores session in browser localStorage by default
- Automatically restores state on app reload via Firebase SDK
- Users remain logged in until they manually log out

**Inventory Data**

- Authenticated Users:
  - Firestore stores all data in `users/{uid}/items`
  - Auto-synced in real-time, with offline buffering
- Guest Mode / Offline Users:
  - IndexedDB used for structured offline CRUD
  - Synced to Firestore once the user logs in or reconnects
  - Uses `idb` or custom wrapper hook for data access

**Caching Strategy**

- Recipes from API may optionally be cached in localStorage (read-only)
- UI state (e.g. scroll position, tabs) is stored transiently in-memory or sessionStorage

> üí° This hybrid strategy ensures maximum usability, even with zero connectivity, while keeping Firebase usage within free tier limits.

---

## 6. Workflows

---

### 6.1 Auth Flow

The authentication process ensures that user data remains isolated and persistent across sessions. Firebase Authentication handles secure login and state persistence, while React manages app state for routing and access control.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Login/Signup Page] --> B[Firebase Auth]
    B --> C[Return UID Token]
    C --> D[Store user context in app state]
    D --> E[Redirect to Main Dashboard]
    E --> F[Access Firestore with UID scope]
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. User enters credentials on login or signup form
2. Firebase Auth returns a `UID` and sets session token
3. App initializes a global auth context (`AuthProvider`)
4. Firestore reads/writes are scoped under `users/{uid}/`
5. On logout, context is cleared and user redirected

---

### 6.2 Inventory Flow

Inventory management supports both real-time Firestore sync and offline IndexedDB fallback. Data integrity and UX responsiveness are prioritized.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Submits Form] --> B[Validate Inputs]
    B --> C{Online or Offline?}
    C -- Online --> D[Write to Firestore]
    D --> E[Trigger onSnapshot ‚Üí Live UI update]
    C -- Offline --> F[Store in IndexedDB]
    F --> G[Sync when reconnected]
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. User fills form for `add`, `edit`, or `delete`
2. App validates required fields: `name`, `quantity`, etc.
3. If online:
   - Firestore write under `users/{uid}/items`
   - Firestore‚Äôs `onSnapshot` updates dashboard instantly
4. If offline:
   - Write cached in IndexedDB
   - Sync to Firestore on next reconnection (if user is logged in)

> ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time UI updates and form feedback ensure a smooth experience regardless of connectivity.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

These define the system‚Äôs behavior beyond specific features‚Äîfocusing on performance, reliability, and maintainability to ensure long-term usability.

| **Category**     | **Requirement**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**  | Fast interactions (<100ms), optimized re-renders, IndexedDB for local ops       |
| **Reliability**  | Firestore's real-time sync + offline queueing ensures consistent experience     |
| **Usability**    | Clean, mobile-first layout with accessible forms and responsive feedback        |
| **Security**     | Firestore rules enforce per-user access; auth routes protected at router level  |
| **Maintainability** | Modular component structure, type-safe props, and scoped hooks               |
| **Data Integrity** | Form-level and schema validation prior to submission to prevent bad writes    |
| **Compliance**   | Firebase services are GDPR-compliant by default; only minimal personal data used |

> üîê **Security & compliance are built-in**: Firebase handles encryption, auth, and compliance (e.g. GDPR), reducing burden on the dev team.

The project adheres to best practices in frontend development to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.

* **Component Reusability (React)**
  Build reusable and composable UI components for consistency and modularity. Examples include:

  * `Button`, `Input`, `Modal`, `ItemCard`
  * These atomic components can be combined into complex UIs without rewriting logic

* **State Management with Context & Zustand**
  Purpose: Efficiently manage app-wide and feature-specific state.

  * **React Context** will be used specifically for **auth state**, such as storing the current user's session and UID.

    * Accessible across all components without prop drilling
    * Useful for conditionally rendering protected routes and loading user-specific data
  * **Zustand** is preferred for local state like inventory form data, filters, or UI toggles.

    * Lightweight, scalable alternative to Redux
    * Easy to use for multiple independent state slices (e.g., `useInventoryStore`, `useUIStore`)

* **Separation of Concerns**
  Enforce modularity between data handling, business logic, and UI.

  * API logic isolated in `/services`
  * Data-fetching and sync handled by custom hooks (e.g., `useFirestoreInventory()`)
  * Components focused purely on rendering and interactions

* **Type Safety with TypeScript (Optional)**

  * Type definitions for:

    * Inventory item: `Item { id: string, name: string, quantity: number, status: string, tags?: string[] }`
    * Auth user: `User { uid: string, email: string }`
    * Recipe format from Spoonacular API
  * Helps catch bugs at compile time and improves autocomplete and refactoring

* **Project Structure & Naming**
  Consistent folder and file naming to improve navigation and clarity.

### 9.2 Anticipated Challenges

| Challenge                           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offline Edge Cases**              | Syncing locally cached data (IndexedDB) with Firestore after reconnecting |
| **Merge Conflicts on Sync**         | Avoiding duplication when an item is edited offline then resynced         |
| **Security Rule Misconfigurations** | Firebase rules must be restrictive and tested to prevent data leakage     |
| **Browser Storage Limits**          | Ensure guest mode remains within IndexedDB capacity (typically 50MB)      |
| **API Rate Limits (Spoonacular)**   | Free-tier limits require smart caching and usage throttling               |

> üß† Proper error boundaries, retry strategies, and fallback logic must be part of sync logic.

---

### 9.3 Known Bugs (WIP)

Bug tracking will be managed via GitHub Issues with clear reproduction steps and labels (e.g., `bug`, `sync`, `ui-glitch`).

Initial known issues include:

* üîÅ Double-write events on reconnect after offline actions
* ‚ö†Ô∏è UI race conditions when two tabs update inventory simultaneously
* üìÜ Expiry dates occasionally misordered due to local timezone mismatches
* üîí Firestore rules require updates when new item fields are added

---

### 9.4 Dev Process

#### Feature-First Iterative Development

* Small, isolated branches for each feature (e.g., `feat/inventory-filter`)
* Regular merges into `main` via pull requests with code reviews
* Use GitHub Projects or Issues for roadmap visibility

#### Version Control

* Semantic commit messages (e.g., `feat: add tag filter`, `fix: prevent duplicate sync`)
* Git tags for marking release versions

#### Deployment Workflow

* Firebase CLI used for staging and production deploys
* `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` configured per environment
* Future CI/CD via GitHub Actions can handle automated tests + deploys

#### Documentation

* `README.md` with project overview, setup steps, Firebase configuration, and contribution guide
* Each service, hook, and major component documented inline with JSDoc or TypeScript comments

---

### 9.5 Testing Strategy

Robust testing ensures code quality, data integrity, and UX consistency.

#### Unit Testing

* Tools: **Vitest** or **Jest**
* Target:

  * Custom hooks (e.g., `useInventory`, `useFirestoreSave`)
  * Utility functions (e.g., sorting, filtering, validation)
  * Zustand store logic

#### Component Testing

* Tools: **React Testing Library** + **Vitest**
* Focus on:

  * Form behavior (`AddItemForm`, `LoginForm`)
  * Conditional rendering based on auth state
  * Dialogs, modals, and interactive components

#### Integration Testing

* End-to-end flow simulations using **Cypress** or **Playwright**
* Scenarios:

  * Auth + inventory item CRUD
  * Chatbot recipe suggestion and step navigation
  * Offline + reconnect sync test

#### Manual & Exploratory Testing

* Done regularly during dev using real device simulators/emulators (mobile-first)
* Validate UI responsiveness and accessibility

#### Firebase Rules Testing

* Use Firebase Emulator Suite to:

  * Simulate authenticated/unauthenticated users
  * Test Firestore rule coverage using unit scripts

> ‚úÖ All new features must be accompanied by basic unit or integration tests before merge.
