## 5. System Architecture

---

### 5.1 Technology Stack

| **Layer**            | **Tool/Technology**        | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**         | React + Vite                | UI rendering and app logic. Vite ensures fast build and hot reload in dev. |
| **Styling**          | Tailwind CSS                | Rapid UI development with mobile-first, utility-based design system.       |
| **Authentication**   | Firebase Auth               | Email/password-based user login; session persists across app reloads.      |
| **Database**         | Firebase Firestore          | Real-time NoSQL DB for storing user-specific inventory and recipes.        |
| **Local Caching**    | IndexedDB + localStorage    | Caches data offline; enables guest usage or fallback when offline.         |
| **Hosting** *(opt.)* | Firebase Hosting            | Lightweight static site hosting with HTTPS and global CDN (free tier).     |

> üîê **Only auth and inventory data are synced to Firebase.** Everything else (chat context, UI state, recipe browsing history) is handled locally for privacy, performance, and offline access.

---

### 5.2 Firebase Firestore Structure

We follow a **user-isolated data structure**. Each user has a personal `items` subcollection, which ensures data privacy and clean querying.

```plaintext
users/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {uid}/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ items/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {itemId} : {
             name: string,         // Item name, e.g. "Tomatoes"
             quantity: number,     // Integer or float depending on unit
             createdAt: timestamp, // Firestore auto timestamp
             status: string,       // e.g., "fresh", "expired", "used"
             tags?: string[]       // Optional: e.g. ["vegetable", "organic"]
        }
```

- Document path: `users/{uid}/items/{itemId}`
- All Firestore calls use the authenticated UID from Firebase Auth
- Firebase SDK automatically supports offline reads + queued writes

Best practices:
- Use `createdAt` for sorting/expiration features
- Filter and categorize via `tags`
- Store units or measurement type via additional fields if needed later

---

### 5.3 Flow Diagrams

#### Auth Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[App Load] --> B{Is user authenticated?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Fetch user data from Firestore]
    B -- No --> D[Redirect to Login page]
    D --> E[User signs in or registers]
    E --> C
```

- `onAuthStateChanged` checks Firebase Auth session on load
- If authenticated, fetch inventory from Firestore
- If not, redirect user to login or load guest mode with local data

---

#### Inventory Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[App Start] --> B{Online or Offline?}
    B -- Online --> C{Is user authenticated?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Sync IndexedDB to Firestore]
    C -- No --> E[Use IndexedDB only (guest mode)]
    B -- Offline --> F[Load Inventory from IndexedDB]
```

- Ensures full CRUD even in guest or offline state
- Changes queued and synced to Firestore when reconnected
- IndexedDB stores the exact same structure for compatibility

---

#### Recipe Chatbot Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Inventory Page] --> B[User clicks "Suggest Recipe"]
    B --> C[Collect available ingredients]
    C --> D[Send ingredients to Spoonacular API]
    D --> E[Receive recipe suggestions]
    E --> F[Display cards with "Cook Now" option]
    F --> G[Show interactive, step-by-step instructions]
```

- Local pantry is the source of truth
- API queries only include ingredients the user has
- Assistant uses formatted prompt logic (non-AI) to query Spoonacular

---

### 5.4 Data Persistence

**Authentication Persistence**

- Firebase Auth stores session in browser localStorage by default
- Automatically restores state on app reload via Firebase SDK
- Users remain logged in until they manually log out

**Inventory Data**

- Authenticated Users:
  - Firestore stores all data in `users/{uid}/items`
  - Auto-synced in real-time, with offline buffering
- Guest Mode / Offline Users:
  - IndexedDB used for structured offline CRUD
  - Synced to Firestore once the user logs in or reconnects
  - Uses `idb` or custom wrapper hook for data access

**Caching Strategy**

- Recipes from API may optionally be cached in localStorage (read-only)
- UI state (e.g. scroll position, tabs) is stored transiently in-memory or sessionStorage

> üí° This hybrid strategy ensures maximum usability, even with zero connectivity, while keeping Firebase usage within free tier limits.

---

## 6. Workflows

---

### 6.1 Auth Flow

The authentication process ensures that user data remains isolated and persistent across sessions. Firebase Authentication handles secure login and state persistence, while React manages app state for routing and access control.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Login/Signup Page] --> B[Firebase Auth]
    B --> C[Return UID Token]
    C --> D[Store user context in app state]
    D --> E[Redirect to Main Dashboard]
    E --> F[Access Firestore with UID scope]
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. User enters credentials on login or signup form
2. Firebase Auth returns a `UID` and sets session token
3. App initializes a global auth context (`AuthProvider`)
4. Firestore reads/writes are scoped under `users/{uid}/`
5. On logout, context is cleared and user redirected

---

### 6.2 Inventory Flow

Inventory management supports both real-time Firestore sync and offline IndexedDB fallback. Data integrity and UX responsiveness are prioritized.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Submits Form] --> B[Validate Inputs]
    B --> C{Online or Offline?}
    C -- Online --> D[Write to Firestore]
    D --> E[Trigger onSnapshot ‚Üí Live UI update]
    C -- Offline --> F[Store in IndexedDB]
    F --> G[Sync when reconnected]
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. User fills form for `add`, `edit`, or `delete`
2. App validates required fields: `name`, `quantity`, etc.
3. If online:
   - Firestore write under `users/{uid}/items`
   - Firestore‚Äôs `onSnapshot` updates dashboard instantly
4. If offline:
   - Write cached in IndexedDB
   - Sync to Firestore on next reconnection (if user is logged in)

> ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time UI updates and form feedback ensure a smooth experience regardless of connectivity.

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

These define the system‚Äôs behavior beyond specific features‚Äîfocusing on performance, reliability, and maintainability to ensure long-term usability.

| **Category**     | **Requirement**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**  | Fast interactions (<100ms), optimized re-renders, IndexedDB for local ops       |
| **Reliability**  | Firestore's real-time sync + offline queueing ensures consistent experience     |
| **Usability**    | Clean, mobile-first layout with accessible forms and responsive feedback        |
| **Security**     | Firestore rules enforce per-user access; auth routes protected at router level  |
| **Maintainability** | Modular component structure, type-safe props, and scoped hooks               |
| **Data Integrity** | Form-level and schema validation prior to submission to prevent bad writes    |
| **Compliance**   | Firebase services are GDPR-compliant by default; only minimal personal data used |

> üîê **Security & compliance are built-in**: Firebase handles encryption, auth, and compliance (e.g. GDPR), reducing burden on the dev team.

---

---

## 9. Development Framework

---

### 9.1 Code Principles

The project will follow clear, modular, and maintainable coding principles:

- **Component Reusability (React)**  
  - Build UI elements as atomic components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `ItemRow`)  
  - Use composition to extend functionality rather than duplicate logic

- **State Management via Context or Zustand**  
  - Global auth state via `React Context`  
  - Local or per-feature state with lightweight tools like `Zustand` or `useReducer`  
  - Avoid prop drilling and maintain predictable state updates

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  - Logic extracted into custom hooks (`useInventory`, `useAuth`)  
  - API and storage logic separated into service modules  
  - UI, state, and side-effects clearly decoupled

- **Type Safety (Optional TypeScript)**  
  - Types/interfaces for inventory items, recipe structures, and auth users  
  - Reduce runtime bugs and improve DX (Developer Experience)

- **Naming & Structure**  
  - File-based routing and modular folders (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/services`, `/pages`)  
  - Clear and consistent naming conventions (camelCase, kebab-case for files)

---

### 9.2 Anticipated Challenges

| Challenge                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Offline Edge Cases**            | Handling item updates when offline and syncing to Firestore without loss   |
| **Merge Conflicts on Sync**       | Managing item duplication or overwrites during reconnection                |
| **Security Rule Misconfigurations** | Risk of overexposing user data or blocking legitimate actions              |
| **Browser Storage Limits**        | IndexedDB has storage limits that vary by browser (~50MB typically)        |
| **API Rate Limits (Spoonacular)** | Free tier limits could restrict usage under heavy testing or load          |

> üîÑ Offline-first logic adds significant complexity‚Äîproper testing and fallback flows are essential.

---

### 9.3 Known Bugs (WIP)
