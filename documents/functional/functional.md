  - Users can manually add items they already have in their pantry, including quantity and (optionally) expiration dates. This helps in keeping track of the food they have and prevents over-purchasing.
  
- **Smart Shopping Cart:**  
  - The system cross-references pantry items with the recipe requirements. This ensures that ingredients that are already in stock are not added to the shopping list, saving time and money.
  - Omits ingredients already available, preventing duplicate purchases and optimizing shopping.

*Example:*  
If a recipe requires 200g of pasta and the user has 100g in stock, the shopping list is adjusted to add only the additional 100g required.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    User->>App: Adds pasta to pantry (100g)
    User->>App: Selects recipe for lasagna
    App->>App: Compares ingredients with pantry
    App->>User: Updates shopping list (only 100g needed)
```

  - A chatbot interacts with users to help them find recipes based on available ingredients or specific preferences. It can understand natural language and suggest recipes accordingly.
  
- **Conversational Guidance:**  
  - The chatbot refines search criteria through dialogue. It can ask follow-up questions like "Do you prefer vegetarian recipes?" or "Do you have any dietary restrictions?" to suggest appropriate recipes.

*Example:*  
A user mentions they have salmon but isnâ€™t sure how to prepare it. The chatbot will propose several salmon-based recipes and allow the user to choose one.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Chatbot
    User->>Chatbot: "I have salmon, what can I make?"
    Chatbot->>Chatbot: Refines recipe options
    Chatbot->>User: Suggests salmon-based recipes
```

#### d. Recipe Access & Cooking Guidance
